        Hey, I'm Kang! In my 25 short years, I've lived a very interesting life. 
    </p>

    <p>
        My nationality is Korean, but I was born in Bangkok, Thailand. By the time I was five, I had already lived in three different countries and visited over ten. When I turned five, my parents finally decided to settle down and we moved to the United States.I grew up in a suburb of Dallas and I lived the typical suburban lifestyle. However in the tenth grade, I became really interested in music and particularly hip-hop music. For the rest of high school, my friends and I spent most of our free time recording music. This hobby eventually paid off my college tuition.

        When I was a senior in high school, one of the top music labels in South Korea was having an open audition and I sent in a video audition for fun. Somehow I managed to get in, but I had to reject the offer since I was going to the University of Texas at Austin to study biology. However, due to my practice as a songwriter, I got a return offer to be a ghostwriter for the label. I took this offer and it eventually paid for my education.

        I studied biology in college since I have always wanted to be a doctor, however as the years progressed in college and I learned more about the medical industry, I began to lose my interest. At this point it was too late to change my major so I got the degree, but I knew I wanted to pursue something else. Two of my roommates in college were CS majors, so I got the idea of pursuing CS and this is why I am at the University of Texas at Austin Coding Bootcamp today.
